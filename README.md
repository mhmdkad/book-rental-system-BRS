# book-rental-system-BRS
book rental system:

There are functions which are open for anonymous users. They can

    search for books by author or title,
    list books by genre,
    view the data sheet of a selected book.

There are two types of users in this BRS: readers and librarians. A registered and authenticated (logged in) reader can

    borrow a book,
    view his/her active book rentals, and
    view the details of a selected book rental.

A librarian can

    add, edit or delete a book,
    add, edit or delete a genre,
    list book rentals,
    view the details of a book rental,
    change some status on a book rental, like status, deadline, note.
